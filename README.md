The attached code was developped progressively from simple task of Ticker finding to full assignment.

If you want to see the optimized version that works for multiple years and with a single loop please go directly to the last Sub in the submitted code : "YearlyPricingChangewithMaxMinVarMultiYearVersionSingleLoop()"
